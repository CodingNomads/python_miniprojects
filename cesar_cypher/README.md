# Caesar Cipher

Replicate one of the oldest known encryption by writing your own code.

Apply a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) of 7 to the `secret` variable.

P.S.: <[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/dentist.php](http://www.montypython.50webs.com/scripts/Series_1/29.htm)> ;)

You can start with the following code:

```python
lowercase_letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
secret = "I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year, and so are the mangoes."
cipher = 7
```

You can tackle this challenge using the skills you've learned so far in the course. It might take you a moment to figure out a solution, but give it a try.

Some concepts that you've learned about so far that might come in handy are looping, conditional statements, string methods, slicing, and indexing.

As a stretch task you could adapt your solution so that it preserves capitalization of the original text, and that you can change the cipher to get a different encoding.

Can you also write code to reverse the encryption?
