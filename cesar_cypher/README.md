# Cesar Cypher

Replicate one of the oldest known encryption in code.

Apply a [Cesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) of 7 to the 'secret' variable.

P.S.: <http://www.montypython.net/scripts/dentist.php> ;)

You can start with the following code:

```python
secret = "I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year, and so are the mangoes."
cipher = 7
```
