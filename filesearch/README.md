# File Search

Write a script that searches a folder you specify (as well as all its subfolders) on your computer and compiles a list of
all `.jpg` files. The list should contain the complete path of each `.jpg` file.

If you are feeling bold, create a list containing each type of file extension you find in the folder.

Start with a small folder to make it easy to check whether your program is working correctly. Then switch that
small folder name with a bigger folder.

This program should work for any specified folder on your computer.
